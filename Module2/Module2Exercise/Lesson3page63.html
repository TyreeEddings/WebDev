      <p>ORLANDO, Fla. â€” All of the Pearl River cheer squad's hard work and dedication over the past months has come to fruition as the Wildcats claimed the Universal Cheerleaders Association's All-Girl National Championship Saturday night at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.</p>

      <p>championship marks the first in Pearl River's history.</p>

<p>rds can't even describe how proud I am of the girls," Pearl River coach Sarah Smith said. "The team executed so well, not once but twice; in the most high-pressure situation that you can imagine. These girls are exceptional athletes. They are relentless in their daily pursuit of perfection, and it absolutely set them apart on the nationals floor.</p>

      <p>"The key to our victory was strong veteran leadership, focused athletes and high standards for all of our skills."</p>
