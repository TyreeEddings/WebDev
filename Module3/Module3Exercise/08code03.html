      Capitan</strong> is a 3,000-foot (910 m) vertical rock formation
      in Yosemite National Park, located on the north side of Yosemite
      Valley, near its western end. The granite monolith is one of the
      world's favorite challenges for rock climbers. The formation was
      named "El Capitan" by the Mariposa Battalion when it explored the
      valley in 1851.</p>

      style="float:right;padding:12px;width:100px;height:80px;"><strong>Tunnel
      View</strong> is a viewpoint on State Route 41 located directly east
      of the Wawona Tunnel as one enters Yosemite Valley from the south.
      The view looks east into Yosemite Valley including the southwest face
      of El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil Falls. This is, to many, the
      first views of the popular attractions in Yosemite.</p>
